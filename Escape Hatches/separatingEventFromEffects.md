2.Effects run whenever synchronization is needed.
3.Logic inside event handlers is not reactive.
4.Logic inside Effects is reactive.
5.You can move non-reactive logic from Effects into Effect Events.
6.Only call Effect Events from inside Effects.
7.Donâ€™t pass Effect Events to other components or Hooks.
